**QT** is a compressive **C++** framework for developing cross-platform GUI
applications. The library uses the *Write Once, Compile Everywhere* paradigm. It
allows programmers to use a single source tree for applications that could run
on Window, Mac Os and Linux which makes perfect for embedded systems like
Rasberry Pi.

The purpose of this course is to teach students to write GUI programs using Qt5.
We will start by reviewing advanced OOP mechanisms (like polymorphism and
inheritance) of modern C++ using the 14
standard. After that, the student will start with a simple "Hello Qt" dialog and
quickly dive into more advanced topic like slots and signals. The final project
consist of creating a simple spreadsheet application with a set of useful
capabilities.

Upon completion of this course, you should be able to 

- Confidently use C++ OOP paradigms
- Create its own dialogs and applications.
- Extend the concept of signals and slots to more event driven programming
challenges.
