### Learning Resources

#### Readings

- [BS] [Blanchette & Summerfield, C++ GUI Programming with Qt4 ](https://www.amazon.fr/GUI-Programming-Qt4-Jasmin-Blanchette/dp/0132354160)
- [G] [Mark Gregoire, Professional C++](https://www.amazon.fr/Professional-C-Marc-Gregoire/dp/1119421306) 


Chapters from these two texts, as well as relevant resources, will be referenced alongside each lecture, under the [Lectures]({{ "/lectures" | relative_url }}) section. 

We strongly recommend that you read these as the semester progresses, to help you understand the concepts and algorithms taught in class (note that the material of the class is a simplifid version of the book). 


### Communication

[Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/ksyr6kbfflk5k6) is intended for all announcements, general questions about the course, clarifications about assignments, student questions to each other, discussions about material, and so on.

We strongly encourage all students to participate in discussion, ask, and answer questions in class as well as through Piazza!

### Grading

The class requirements include a set of homeworks at the end of each lecture.
This will account as **20%** of your grade. You'll a present a project which
involve to create a complete Qt application and will count as **50%** of your
grade. A final theoretical exam will test your understanding of Qt code and
will count as **20%**. The final **10%** will reflect your behavior in class.
**Each absence will cause you 1 point from this grade**.

### Homework Assignments


At the end of each lecture, you'll be assigned a coding  homework. For each homework,  **you may work in groups  of up to three students total**. You're advised to upload
your code via [github](https://github.com/) to keep a trace of achieved work.




### Collaboration Policy


- The purpose of student collaboration is to facilitate learning, not to circumvent it. Studying the material in groups is strongly encouraged. It is also allowed to seek help from other students in understanding the material needed to solve a particular homework problem, provided no written notes (including code) are shared, or are taken at that time, and provided learning is facilitated, not circumvented. The actual solution must be done by each student alone.
